# Stereo Imaging

In order to accurately and reliably determine a location on a windshield for localized dimming, it is necessary to locate the 3-dimensional positions of drivers' eyeballs and the
positions of high-intensity light sources external to a vehicle. Stereo imaging seems to be the best way to locate these points. This repository houses code that
demonstrates a process of implementing stereo imaging for standard applications. It is to serve as an introduction to the mathematics and tools used to acquire
corresponding features found in a pair of images and to project 3D coordinates onto a 2D image plane.
